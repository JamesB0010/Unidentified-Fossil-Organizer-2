# Games Audio Implementation - UFO #

## Project Overview ##

For our project we have chosen to use one of our team members previous projects to sonify. That project being James Bland's UFO he helped develop during Collaborative practice. The justification for this was due to the smaller scale of the level it allows a variety of sounds to be placed within a localised space meaning sounds must be carefully balanced to not overwhelm the player. Additionally the space can be easily modified to accommodate for different foley sounds (for example wood floor, to carpet and metallic sounds for the boiler room). As a team we intend, and since have proceeded, to work as a team in order to create a diverse array of sounds in order to give every member ample opportunity to be equally involved in every stage of the pipeline and gain the most marks for each other.

## Setting up the Project ##

To easily collaborate upon the project we have made use of the GitHub classroom provided to easily collaborate between group members. Each of use have our own branch, a main branch our changes will be merged into alongside a solo branch holding the oldest version of the project in case we need to refer to deleted code. We have set up everyone on FMOD 2.03 (Unity Verified) in order to edit sounds as well as deciding what software will be used to record and edit within which will be outlined in the next section.

See below a screenshot of our GitHub for reference and you can see all of our commits via your control over the classroom itself.

## Tools for Sound Creation ##

When it comes to the subject of actually creating the sounds for the game, while things like our Game Engine being Unity is essentially set in stone and FMOD is required in order to actually get marks. The method and means of recording and editing can change. 

Our Audio Members Oliver and Dylan are using Pro Tool for their recording and editing since they have a majority of their experience within the workspace whereas on the Games Side James and Josh will be utilising the free editing software as Reaper just because it serves an extremely similar purpose and is free to use permanently without a license for our teams purposes but this remains the only difference in Software between team members at this time.

## Planning out the Sounds ##

To plan out the sounds our Audio members produced a spotting sheet seen here in a screenshot and has been split into a spotting sheet and a separate dialogue sheet in order for us to write down the dialogue for recording.

Additionally we took every sound from the spotting sheet and began adding them into a GitHub Projects board in order to split each sound into a more appealing way. As well as categorising the sounds based on type we also added an additional identifier of whether the sounds would be Immediate or Spatialised so when it comes to implementation we can easily identify eds to happen and don't waste time asking follow up questions (although we are absolutely allowed to if still unsure).

We planned to book out the studio either every week or every other week in order to work our way through each sounds type in order to streamline the workflow (E.g. We work our way through Dialogue, then onto Foley, SFX etc) 

The Games Students are also able to alter aspects of the existing project in order to facilitate certain aspects of the game (Take note of things from a simple intercom system to a full satirical take on Death Strandings Beach seen below). These were listed on the GitHub as well in a Programming task section but the priority is naturally lower.

## Current Implementations (as of Prototype Submission) ##

- PA System is spatialised and while some clean up is required does work and uses the multi instrument in order to play a different voice line every 30 seconds

- Mothership Voice Lines play on the first pick up of every bone and will provide entertainment to the player as they collect games with a bonus unique line when you collect them all

- Adaptive Music is present in the main game that adds more instruments 

- A more sinister form of the music is present during the Beach Scene you can be transported to

- Foley sounds have been recorded but are still in the editing phase right now

## Week by Week Breakdown ##

Week 1 - This week had nothing too eventful and was just all of the team members meeting each other and deciding upon the project to use. Weighing up the pros and cons of using either the premade Samurai scene or going with one of our own members past projects ultimately going with the UFO project

Week 2 - This week was the week in which we put our heads together and started to nail down exactly the types of sounds we wanted and what changes would have to be made or additions to the main project to easily implement them in future weeks. These would include things like the Go-Kart, Intercom System and Beach level

Week 3 - The first recording session that we had started with getting ourselves use to the feel of setting up a professional recording scenario. We worked through the Initial PA Lady lines one by one taking multiple takes in order to get the best takes possible to edit down into the best take. A dialogue system was also added into the game to allow us to add in more dialogue in the future utilising an external plugin that would still be useable in conjuncture with FMOD

Week 4 - Another Dialogue recording session occurred in the MP studio in which we powered through the final set of voice lines for the mothership and alien which was contributed to by all of the group in some way (outlined later on). This week the music had started being implemented along with outlining how to add in the PA System into the game itself before adding sound into it

Week 5 - This week consisted of the first batch of Foley noises being recorded with us just going in and grabbing a variety of objects to try and produce a sound fitting of the alien walking. This was also the week in which the PA System and Mothership lines were fully implemented into the project and working. Additionally music was fully implemented into the project and just needs some finishing touches

Week 6 - Prototype Submission
